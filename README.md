# Main code
code space of article"An Interventional Brain-Computer Interface Long-term EEG Collection and Motion Classification of Quadruped Mammal" 

This code space contains the four main codes used in the paper, i.e. the four different models used in this paper to classify EEG signals:

1.CNN_5K
Analysis of EEG signals using CNN models, including reading of data, data preprocessing, model loading, 5-fold cross-training and performance of the optimal model on the validation set and confusion matrix plotting.
2.LSTM_5K
Analyze EEG signals using LSTM model, including data reading, data preprocessing, model loading, 5-fold cross-training, and the performance of the optimal model on the validation set and confusion matrix plotting.
3.RNN_5K
Analyze EEG signals using RNN models, including data reading, data preprocessing, model loading, 5-fold cross-training, and the performance of the optimal model on the validation set and confusion matrix plotting.
4.SVM
The analysis of EEG signals using SVM model includes reading of data, data preprocessing, etc.

Sorry due to privacy reasons, our raw data is not put in the project, so the code can't run directly. But the code is problem-free and the model structure is for reference.
